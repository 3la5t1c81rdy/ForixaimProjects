Triple X is a game where you solve a series of numbers that add up to (X) and Multiply to (Y)

Challenge: Translate this code to your favorite language. (Java, Rust, C#, Python, whatever language. As long as it works and it's playable I will accept.)
Also you may modify the story. For Python you may use the code itself and import it and run it. (Python may be the easiest)
